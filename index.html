# Advanced date picker - Jotform widget

The Advanced date Picker is a Jotform widget that allows you to include a calendar in your form where you can have your users select specific dates. There are lots of configuration options, so you can present exactly the calendar you need.

I created this widget to fill a gap for our theater community. We use Jotform for our audition packets, and we need a way to ask people to provide a list of days they are unavailable for rehearsal.

Traditional date pickers don't provide the ability to blackout specific dates. In our case, we only rehearse on specific days of the week, and we want to exclude certain days, even when they would normally be available.

## Features
